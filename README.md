# xmlslicer

This is utility designed for use with [NodeJS][http://nodejs.org/] scripts to assist with liberating data from XML feeds and files and converting them into useful JSON snippets.

Using [libxmljs](https://github.com/polotek/libxmljs) as the core XML processing tool, xmlslicer is designed to help you extract the pieces of useful data from XML and leaving the rest.  It is designed to be used by people with a good handle on [XPath](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/) as that is the core technique used to extract the _useful bits_ from the XML.
